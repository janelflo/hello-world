Getting started with GitHub

Hi! My name is Janel! I am an aspiring developer working toward my goals one day at a time. I am a coffee addict, F45 fanatic, dog mom to a 12-year-old Shih Tzu named Conner, and a dance music lover. These days you'll find me honing in on my coding skills and enjoying family and friends in between.
